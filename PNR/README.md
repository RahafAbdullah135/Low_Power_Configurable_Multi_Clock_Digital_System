# PNR (Place and Route)
PNR (Place and Route) is a critical stage in the digital design flow where the synthesized gate-level netlist is physically implemented on a silicon chip. It involves placing the standard cells (logic gates, flip-flops, etc.) and routing the interconnections between them, ensuring that the design meets timing, area, power, and signal integrity constraints. The PNR process transforms the abstract design into a layout that can be fabricated.

# Key Steps in the PNR Process
### 1-Floorplanning
**Objective:**
Define the overall structure of the chip, including the placement of major functional blocks, I/O pads, power grids, and other critical regions.

### 2-Placement
**Objective:** 
Position the standard cells (gates, flip-flops) within the defined floorplan.

### 3-Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)
**Objective:**
Distribute the clock signal to all sequential elements (flip-flops, latches) with minimal skew and balanced delay.

### 4-Routing
**Objective:**
Connect the placed cells according to the netlist while adhering to design rules and optimizing for timing, power, and signal integrity.

### 5-Timing Closure
**Objective:** 
Ensure that the design meets all timing requirements, including setup and hold times, across all paths.

### 6-Power Optimization
**Objective:**
Minimize power consumption, both dynamic (switching power) and static (leakage power).

### 7-Design Rule Checking (DRC)
**Objective:**
Ensure that the physical design complies with all manufacturing design rules specified by the foundry.

### 8-Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) Check
**Objective:** Ensure that the physical layout matches the original netlist.
