## Formal verification - post DFT
Formal verification post-DFT is an essential step that ensures the functional integrity of a digital design after testability features are added. It gives designers confidence that the DFT modifications will not adversely affect the circuit's intended operation, thereby ensuring that the final product is both testable and functionally correct.
