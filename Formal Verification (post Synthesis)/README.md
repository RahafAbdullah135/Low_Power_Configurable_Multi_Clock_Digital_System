## Formal Verification - Post Synthesis
Formal verification post-synthesis in digital design is the process of mathematically proving that the synthesized gate-level netlist (the design after synthesis) is functionally equivalent to the original Register Transfer Level (RTL) design. This step is crucial to ensure that no functional errors were introduced during the synthesis process.
