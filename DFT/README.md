# DFT (Design for Testability)
is a set of techniques used in digital design to make it easier to test the fabricated hardware for manufacturing defects.
The goal of DFT is to ensure that a digital circuit, such as an integrated circuit (IC), can be thoroughly tested to detect
any defects that may have been introduced during the manufacturing process.
